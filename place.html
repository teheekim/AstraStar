	<h1 style="color:blue;text-align:center;">The City Life</h1>
	<p>The city is my home and will always feel like home to me.</p>
	<p>I do not live in your typical nice aparmett or luxiours home, but rather in a dark loft that my adopted father provided me with. <p/>
	<p>It is a spacious room  with a training sight just oustide my back door.</p>
	<p>My favorite part of this loft is the front yard which has a beautiful cherry blossom tree.</p>
	<p>The rooftop of this loft has a lovely city view which is way better at night</p>
