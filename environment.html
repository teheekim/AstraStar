	<p>I live amnogst chaos and I love it. This city is always Chaotic, it always rains, which is my favorite type of wheater.</p>
	<p>The city I live in is run by the mafia. There are so many types of gangs in this city that at times it is'nt safe but the police dont do anything about.</p>
	<p> During the nights you do hear a lot of fights outside of my apartment but that dosent scare me.</p>
	<p>What makes this less scary is the sound of rain and thunder during the day and night.</p>
